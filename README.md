# Sociopath-it

**Sociopath-it** is a suite of Python tools for data cleaning, harmonization, analysis, and visualization — built for sociologists who love code and distrust objectivity just enough to do it right.

## Overview

Sociopath-it is structured into three main domains — each named with the proper degree of irony:

| Module | Description                                                                                                              |
|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cleansing/` | Harmonization and data management tools — variable cleaning, codebook recoding, ID realignment, and sanity restoration.  |
| `analyses/` | Statistical, text, and causal modeling tools — from regression to reflexivity, and everything in between.                |
| `visuals/` | Visualization suite based on my aesthetic guidelines. White backgrounds, semantic palettes, and Bourdieu-approved taste. |
